 <h3>School Belief</h3>
 <p>We go to school to get ready for the future; yes it's a long journey and kids usually hate it but in the long run you develop the skills and techniques that one would carry
 for a life time helping them out along the way. Even if they say they don't care once they reach the point of what they want to do and start taking classes they would wish they 
 paid more attention.<br>
